Portfolio Item Scope Change Chart
=================================

Barry Mullan (December 2015) 

## Overview

This chart visualizes the change in feature commitment during a release / program increment. This will be useful to determine if changes in scope are impacting delivery of original scope. It uses the concept of a baseline which can either be based on the first day of the release or at the end of the first sprint.

Features not in the original baseline will be shown "below the line" while features removed will be removed from the top. Clicking on any column will display in a table below the features that make up the selected series. In addition a popup table will list all features added or removed since the baseline.
